                <li><h2>&#9830; Challenges Faced:</h2></li>
                <li><p>The challenges faced during the CS50AI projects varied depending on the complexity of 
                    the topics covered. Here are some key difficulties encountered:</p></li>
                <li>&#10625; Search Algorithms (Tic-Tac-Toe & Degrees):Implementing Minimax in Tic-Tac-Toe was tricky due to recursion. BFS in Degrees was slow on large 
                    datasets, requiring optimization. Debugging search algorithms was challenging because small logic errors led to infinite loops or incorrect paths.</li>
                <li>&#10625; Knowledge Representation (Knights):Small errors in logic rules caused incorrect results, making debugging difficult.Defining logical rules correctly was difficult—small mistakes led to completely incorrect results.
                    Debugging was frustrating since AI doesn’t give clear error messages, making it hard to find the problem.
                    Managing multiple constraints at once was challenging, especially when conflicting rules caused contradictions.
                    Writing an efficient algorithm to check all conditions without excessive computation required careful structuring.</li>
                <li>&#10625; Uncertainty (Heredity):Applying Bayesian Networks in code was confusing, and minor miscalculations led to wrong probabilities.
                    Debugging probability models was hard because incorrect outputs were often subtle and not immediately obvious.
                </li>
                <li>&#10625; Learning (Shopping & Crossword): Choosing the right features for the Shopping project was tough. Crossword AI struggled with backtracking and constraint satisfaction.
                    The backtracking algorithm sometimes took too long, requiring optimization for faster word selection.
                </li>
                <li>&#10625; Neural Networks (Neural Network Project): Finding the right hyperparameters was hard, and preventing overfitting required careful tuning.
                     Understanding why a neural network made a specific decision was difficult due to the "black-box" nature of deep learning.</li>
                <li>&#10625; Reinforcement Learning (Nim): Balancing exploration vs. exploitation was tricky, and bad reward settings led to poor learning.
                    Ensuring the AI improved over time was difficult, as it sometimes got stuck in suboptimal strategies.
                </li>
                <li>&#10625; Natural Language Processing (Parser): Teaching AI to understand grammar was difficult, and debugging misinterpretations was frustrating.
                    Implementing probabilistic parsing to improve accuracy was difficult and required careful fine-tuning.
                </li>
                <li>&#10625; Neural Networks & Attention (Final Project): Implementing self-attention (Transformers) was challenging due to complex computations and data preprocessing.
                    Fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models required careful adjustment to prevent overfitting or underfitting.
